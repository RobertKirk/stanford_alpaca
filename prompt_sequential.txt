You are asked to come up with a set of 20 diverse task instructions. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verbs for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instrucitons.
3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like open-ended generation, classification, editing, etc.
4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
5. The instructions should be in English.
6. The instructions should be a sequential or compositional instruction containing multiple steps, where each step is related to the previous steps. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
7. Try not to repeat the verbs used for each part of the instruction across instructions to maximize diversity.
8. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.
